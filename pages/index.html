            To start, I should say that I once despised using photoshop. 

          </p>

          <p>
            In a past life, I was an intelligence officer and before that an officer in the Marine Corps. I spent most of the 2000's, after college, on deployments to the Middle East. However, before all that, in the late 90's, when I was in high school, I loved technology. I was part of the U.S. FIRST Robotics team. My friends and I were known as the nerds of our high school class. I would spend my Friday evenings not partying or hanging out at a friends house. Instead, I checked out documentaries on physics from David Goodstein who teaches at CalTech. In my Senior of high school I started to do some programming and made a basic text based adventure. The screen changed color at certain times and I even had the computer beeping at specific moments! However, when I went to the University of California at Davis, I became a History and Political Science double major. I figured that I would make a career in the Marine Corps and a History degree would serve me well. In late 2013 I was watching some videos on Khan Academy about history which I loved to do. On this particular day, the site mentioned that they had some computer programming videos. I decided to check them out and for some reason, I clicked on one about Python. I slowly started to learn about Python and then in the spring of 2015 took a coding boot camp at Tech Talent South. From there, my knowledge and passion for the art has exploded.
